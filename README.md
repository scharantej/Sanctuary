## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- `index.html`: This file will serve as the landing page for the website. It should contain the main content related to mental health resources.
- `resources.html`: This file will provide a comprehensive list of mental health resources, including organizations, helplines, and support groups.
- `about.html`: This file will provide information about the organization or individuals behind the website, its mission, and any relevant background.

### Routes

- `/`: This route will render the `index.html` file and serve as the home page of the website.
- `/resources`: This route will render the `resources.html` file, displaying the list of mental health resources.
- `/about`: This route will render the `about.html` file and provide information about the organization or individuals supporting the resources.

### Implementation

1. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
2. Install Flask using `pip install Flask`.
3. Create a new directory for your project.
4. In the project directory, create a file named `app.py` and add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/resources')
def resources():
    return render_template('resources.html')

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return render_template('about.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

5. Create the HTML files as described above and save them in the project directory.
6. Run the application using `python app.py`.
7. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view the website.

### Additional Considerations

- Use CSS to style the HTML pages and make them visually appealing.
- Add images or graphics to the landing page to make it more engaging.
- Include a contact form or other means for users to connect with the organization or individuals providing the resources.
